So basically you are trapped on the highway behind SLSS (it isn't a highway but the curb mysteriously disappeared), your job is to stay alive as much as possible. The cars are out to get you man, they swerve and reel you just to destroy your mental. It's kind of funny. So yeah, watch the timer, watch the car pattern and hope they don't crash (they will behind you).

Bugs:
1. Fun fact: Isopods are not categorized as bugs. I did NOT know that. Pillbugs (family Armadillididae) and sowbugs (family Porcellionidae) are not insects or true bugs. They are soil-dwelling crustaceans in the order Isopoda (called isopods).
2. Most of the function work, but its slowed down a lot. I've tried to break the timer (line 132-137 of main) but it seems like its lagging all the time. It might just be me. I may just be schizophrenic.
3. There are about 80,000 known species of bugs.
